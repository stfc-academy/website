# Game Assets
After each client update, the assets included with the client are ripped from the PC version of the game and uploaded to the [`game-assets`](https://github.com/stfc-academy/game-assets/) repository. Only `Texture2D` and `Sprite` assets are uploaded to the repository to be used as images in content. These assets can be used as assets for the website. 

For more information on how to use the assets on the website, check out the `Contribute Guide` below.

For more information on ripping the assets, check out the [`game-assets`](https://github.com/stfc-academy/game-assets) repository readme.
