# Welcome
Welcome to `stfc.academy` - an Open Source, community driven, knowledge base for _Star Trek: Fleet Command_.

## Philosophy
The purpose of `stfc.academy` is to provide non-biased, text-based repository of information relating to the **Game Mechanics** of _Star Trek: Fleet Command_ and **Guides and Strategies** for how to play the game. 

This site can also be used as a **Community Hub** to gather a repository of different communities, tools, and content creators all centered around _Star Trek: Fleet Command_. 

This is accomplished by providing the site as an Open Source and Community Driven tool, where anyone is able to contribute content to share their knowledge of the game! Check out the [Contributors](/contributors) page to see who has contributed content or helped support this project.
