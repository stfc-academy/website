# Game Assets
After each client update, the assets included with the client are ripped from the PC version of the game and uploaded to the [game-assets](https://github.com/stfc-academy/website/tree/game-assets) branch of this repository. Only `Texture2D` and `Sprite` assets are uploaded to the repository to be used as images in content.
